title: "Thanksgiving After Mass"
---

I give you thanks, Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God, who have been pleased to nourish me, a sinner and your unworthy servant, with the precious Body and Blood of your Son, our Lord Jesus Christ: this through no merits of mine, but due solely to the graciousness of your mercy. And I pray that this Holy Communion may not be for me an offense to be punished, but a saving plea of forgiveness. May it be for me the armor of faith, and the shield of good will.

_St. Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274)_
