Lord our God, you are patient with sinners and accept our desire to make amends. I acknowledge my sins and I am resolved to change my life. Help me to celebrate this sacrament of your mercy so that I may reform my life and receive from you the gift of everlasting joy. We ask this through Christ our Lord. Amen.
