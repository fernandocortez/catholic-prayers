title: "Prayer to St. Gerard for a mother with child"
---

O Allmighty and Everlasting God, who through the operation of the Holy Ghost didst prepare the body and soul of the glorious Virgin Mary to be a worthy dwelling place of Thy Divine Son; and through the operation of the same Holy Ghost didst sanctify St. John the Baptist while still in his mother's womb, hearken to the prayers of Thy humble servant who implores Thee, through the intercession of St. Gerard, to protect her (me) amidst the dangers of childbearing and to watch over the child with which Thou hast deigned to bless her (me): that it may be cleansed by the saving water of Baptism, and that, after living a Christian life on earth, both the child and its mother may attain to everlasting bliss in Heaven. Amen.
