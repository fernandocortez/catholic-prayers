O Queen of heaven, rejoice! Alleluia. \
For He whom you did merit to bear, Alleluia. \
Has risen, as He said, Alleluia. \
Pray for us to God, Alleluia.

V. Rejoice and be glad, O Virgin Mary. Alleluia. \
__R. For the Lord has risen indeed. Alleluia.__

Let us pray. O God, Who by the resurrection of Your Son, Our Lord Jesus Christ, has given joy to the whole world, grant, we beseech You, that through the intercession of the Virgin Mary, His Mother, we may attain the same joys of eternal life. Through the same Christ Our Lord. Amen.
