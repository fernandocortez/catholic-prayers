title: "Prayer for the Sick"
---

Lord, our God, you sent your Son into the world to bear our infirmities and to endure our sufferings. For your servants who are sick, we ask that your blessing will give them strength to overcome their weakness through the power of patience and the comfort of hope and that with your aid they will soon be restored to health. We ask this through Christ our Lord. Amen.
